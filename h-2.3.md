# DA 210 -- Spring 2025 -- Homework 2.3 -- Professor Lavin

## Directions 

1. These questions will _mostly_ focus on tabular data and Pandas, which will likely include new material, as well as some review and deepening of CS-11x.
2. Don't forget to add your name above. You can edit the markdown by double-clicking on the cell. 
3. Save your work often and commit your changes using git/Github Desktop.
4. When you are finished, save your work, convert the Jupytext Notebook to .html format, and submit the HTML file on Canvas.
5. When you have completed homework 2.1 - 2.4, push your updated repo to Github.com.

__Reminders:__ 

- You are not permitted to get the answers from a classmate or to use Github Copilot, chatGPT, etc. on this homework. These exercises are for practice so, if you use outside help in a way that's not permitted, you are only cheating yourself out of a chance to learn and prepare for future quizzes and tests. 
- Working with an ARC tutor and visiting our TA's office hours are both permitted, but they should be provide advice and support, and you should not expect them to do your work for you. 

```python
## Load Data

import pandas as pd 

# load sample csv
df_gss_sample = pd.read_csv('/Users/tessareilly/Documents/DA-210/GitHub/da-210-spring-2025-h-2.2/gss/data/gss_sample.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='utf8') 

# load rows counts of full data
gss_full_row_counts = pd.read_csv('/Users/tessareilly/Documents/DA-210/GitHub/da-210-spring-2025-h-2.2/gss/data/gss_full_row_counts.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='utf8')

# load years per variable data
gss_years_per_var = pd.read_csv('/Users/tessareilly/Documents/DA-210/GitHub/da-210-spring-2025-h-2.2/gss/meta/gss_data_years_per_var.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='utf8')

# load data dictionary
gss_data_dictionary =  pd.read_csv('/Users/tessareilly/Documents/DA-210/GitHub/da-210-spring-2025-h-2.2/gss/meta/gss_data_dictionary.csv', index_col=0, low_memory=False, encoding='latin1')

```

## Question 1
In the code cell below, print the row count of all values for the `divorce` variable in `df_gss_sample`, as well as a row count for the same variable after dropping all `NA` values in that column. 

```python

print(df_gss_sample['divorce'].value_counts(dropna=False))

print(df_gss_sample['divorce'].dropna().value_counts)
```

---

## Question 2

In the code cell below, use a `loc` method to display the number of rows in `df_gss_sample` with an `hrs1` value greater than or equal to 40 and a `year` value for an odd numbered year. 

```python
filtered_rows = df_gss_sample.loc[(df_gss_sample['hrs1'] >= 40) & (df_gss_sample['year'] % 2 != 0)]

print(len(filtered_rows)) 
```

---

## Question 3

In the code cell below, use a `loc` method to display the number of rows in `df_gss_sample` where the occupation code from the 2010 U.S. Census is any of: 'Computer and information research scientists', 'Computer programmers', or 'Postsecondary teachers'. 

__Hint:__ For a list of 2010 U.S. Census occupation codes and their meanings, see https://www.bls.gov/cps/cenocc2010.htm


```python
occupation_code = ['Computer and information research scientists', 'Computer programmers' , 'Postsecondary teachers']

filtered_rows = df_gss_sample.loc[df_gss_sample['occupation_code'].isin(occupation_codes)]

print(filtered_rows)
```

---

## Question 4 

Use a `loc` method and `str.contains` to search through the variables described in `gss_data_dictionary` and print a list of all variable names where the word 'computer' is in the variable's `label` column. Note that you may need to drop `NA`s from the `label` column before `str.contains` will work properly.

```python
filtered_df = gss_data_dictionary.dropna(subset=['label'])

filtered_vars = filtered_df.loc[filtered_df['label'].str.contains('computer'), 'variable']

print(filtered_vars.tolist())
```

---

## Question 5

Use a `loc` method and `str.contains` to search through the variables described in `gss_data_dictionary` and print a list of all variable names containing any of the words 'rating', 'scale', or 'score'. You can achieve this result with three separate `loc` conditions, or a single regular expression statement. Note that you may need to drop `NA`s from the `label` column before `str.contains` will work properly.


```python
filtered_df = gss_data_dictionary.dropna(subset = ['label'])

matching_variables = filtered_df.loc[
    filtered_df['label'].str.contains(r'rating|scale|score'), 'variable'] 

print(matching_variables.tolist())
```

```python
import os
print(os.getcwd())
```

```python

```
